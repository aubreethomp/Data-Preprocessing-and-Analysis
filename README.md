# Data-Preprocessing-and-Analysis
## Using an initially messy dataset of movies and TV shows to strengthen data cleaning and analysis skills. 
This project cleans and analyzes a dataset of films and TV shows, exploring relationships between various features such as ratings, votes, runtime, genre, and gross earnings. The data is prepared by removing duplicates, extracting director and star information, and classifying titles as movies or TV shows. Key analyses include examining correlations between votes and ratings, assessing the impact of release year, evaluating differences in performance by media type, and investigating which genres and creators (directors, actors) are associated with greater success. Visualizations (using ggplot2) and summary statistics help identify patterns, such as higher-rated TV shows, higher-voted movies, and potential positive correlations between votes and box-office gross. The project also looks at top actors and directors, analyzing their appearances across genres and years, ultimately building a simple regression model to understand factors contributing to an actorâ€™s success
